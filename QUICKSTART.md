# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your Learning Laboratory! Here's how to get started quickly.

## 🚀 First Steps

### 1. Choose Your Focus
Pick what you want to learn:
- **New Language?** → Go to `languages/`
- **Interview Prep?** → Go to `interview-questions/`
- **Math Concepts?** → Go to `mathematics/`
- **Framework?** → Go to `frameworks/`
- **Experiment?** → Go to `experiments/`

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

#### Python
```bash
# Check if Python is installed
python3 --version

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install common packages
pip install pytest numpy pandas matplotlib
```

#### JavaScript/Node.js
```bash
# Check if Node.js is installed
node --version

# Initialize a project
npm init -y

# Install common packages
npm install lodash axios
npm install --save-dev jest
```

#### Java
```bash
# Check if Java is installed
java --version

# Compile a Java file
javac MyProgram.java

# Run
java MyProgram
```

### 3. Run Your First Example

Try the basics:

**Python:**
```bash
cd languages/python
python3 basics.py
```

**JavaScript:**
```bash
cd languages/javascript
node basics.js
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Consistency > Intensity**
   - 30 min daily beats 5 hours once a week

2. **Build, Don't Just Read**
   - Type every example yourself
   - Modify code to see what happens
   - Break things and fix them

3. **Use Active Recall**
   - Try to code without looking at solution
   - Explain concepts in your own words
   - Teach what you learned

4. **Join Communities**
   - Share your progress
   - Ask questions
   - Help others

5. **Track Your Progress**
   - Keep a learning journal
   - Update this README with achievements
   - Review regularly

## 🆘 When You're Stuck

1. **Read error messages carefully**
2. **Google the error message**
3. **Check official documentation**
4. **Search Stack Overflow**
