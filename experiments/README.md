# Experiments

Each subfolder follows `YYYY-MM/topic` naming (example: `2025-10/rust-lifetimes`). Inside an experiment folder:

- `README.md` — outline the question, hypotheses, and outcomes.
- `notes.md` — optional free-form scratchpad or journal.
- `src/` or other language-specific structure — any throwaway code.
- `commands.md` — optional log of scripts, commands, or test runs.

Feel free to break convention if an exploration needs a different layout; the goal is speed and clarity, not rigid structure. When an experiment produces something reusable, move or copy it into `foundations/` and cross-link both locations.
