# Foundations

Reusable code, proofs, notes, or helpers live here after emerging from experiments. Organize by domain using folders like:

- `algorithms/`
- `data-structures/`
- `math/`
- `system-design/`

Each item should include a `README.md` summarizing what it does, when to use it, and any dependencies. Keep foundations clean and documented so future experiments can import them directly.
