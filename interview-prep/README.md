# Interview Prep

Material for interviews sorted by track:

- `behavioral/` — stories, frameworks, and reflections for behavioral questions.
- `coding/` — solved problems, patterns, and links to supporting experiments.
- `system-design/` — architecture prompts, trade-off analyses, and reusable diagrams.

Within each track, use Markdown files or subfolders per topic. Note relevant experiments or foundations for quick cross-reference.
