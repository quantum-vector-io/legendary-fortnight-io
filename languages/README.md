# Programming Languages

This directory contains practice code, projects, and experiments in various programming languages.

## Directory Structure

Each language directory follows this structure:
```
language-name/
├── basics/          # Fundamental syntax and concepts
├── projects/        # Complete projects
├── snippets/        # Useful code snippets
├── exercises/       # Practice exercises
└── README.md        # Language-specific notes
```

## Learning Path

1. **Start with basics** - Syntax, data types, control flow
2. **Master fundamentals** - Functions, OOP, error handling
3. **Build projects** - Apply knowledge in practical scenarios
4. **Explore advanced topics** - Concurrency, memory management, design patterns
5. **Compare languages** - Understand trade-offs and use cases

## Languages

- **Python** - Great for beginners, data science, automation
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Essential for web development
- **Java** - Enterprise applications, Android development
- **C++** - Performance-critical applications, game development
- **Go** - Cloud services, microservices, concurrent programming
- **Rust** - Systems programming with memory safety
- **C#** - Windows applications, game development (Unity), web (ASP.NET)

## Tips

- Write code daily, even if just for 30 minutes
- Understand the "why" not just the "how"
- Read other people's code
- Contribute to open source when ready
- Build real projects to solidify learning
