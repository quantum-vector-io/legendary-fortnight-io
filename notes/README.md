# Notes

Daily log entries go here, named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Use them to capture:

- Discoveries or blockers from ongoing experiments.
- Resources worth revisiting (link to the source).
- Follow-up tasks or open questions.

Keep entries short and link to experiments or foundations when relevant so context stays connected. An example entry is included below.
